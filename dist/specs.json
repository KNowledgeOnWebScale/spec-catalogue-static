document defines a set of Time Functions that can be utilized in SPARQL queries to manipulate time literals. These functions enable the explicit specification of timezones for time periods, including partial time literals like xsd:gYear, as well as floating times, i.e., time literals without a specified timezone. Additionally, they facilitate the retrieval of the inclusive or exclusive bounds of a time period.","title":"Time Functions","adms:status":{"title":"Living Document"}},{"@id":"https://w3id.org/trustenvelope","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#trust-envelope","@type":"CreateAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://w3id.org/trustenvelope"}}],"@type":"Spec","description":"A specification describing the concept trust envelope, a unique contextualization of history and destiny.","title":"Trust Envelope specification","adms:status":{"title":"Unofficial Draft"},"lastUpdated":"2025-10-14"},{"@id":"https://www.eventnotifications.net","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#event-notifications","@type":"CreateAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.eventnotifications.net"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"Event Notifications in Value-Adding Networks","adms:status":{"title":"Living Standard"},"lastUpdated":"2023-09-06"},{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#jsonld1-1","@type":"EndorseAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld/"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"JSON-LD 1.1","adms:status":{"title":"W3C Recommendation"},"lastUpdated":"2020-07-16"},{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#nquads1-1","@type":"EndorseAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"RDF 1.1 N-Quads","adms:status":{"title":"W3C Recommendation"},"lastUpdated":"2014-02-25"},{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#odrl-model","@type":"EndorseAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"ODRL Information Model 2.2","adms:status":{"title":"W3C Recommendation"},"lastUpdated":"2018-02-15"},{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#odrl-vocab","@type":"EndorseAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"ODRL Vocabulary & Expression 2.2","adms:status":{"title":"W3C Recommendation"},"lastUpdated":"2018-02-15"},{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#sparql11-query","@type":"EndorseAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"SPARQL 1.1 Query Language","adms:status":{"title":"W3C Recommendation"}},{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/","hasAction":[{"@id":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/specifications#turtle1-1","@type":"EndorseAction","agent":"https://data.knows.idlab.ugent.be/person/office/#","object":{"@id":"https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/"}}],"@type":"Spec","title":"RDF 1.1 Turtle","adms:status":{"title":"W3C Recommendation"},"lastUpdated":"2014-02-25"}]
